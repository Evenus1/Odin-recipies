  <h2>Discription</h2>
  <p>
    If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.

  <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>serloin steak</li>
    <li>orange juice</li>
    <li>cider viniger</li>
    <li>pepper</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>
    <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.    </li>
  </ol>
